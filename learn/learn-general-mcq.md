Here are 40 multiple-choice questions designed to test a candidate's critical thinking for a Machine Learning Engineer role, based on the provided material.

### **Part 1: Loan Risk Prediction Model**

1.  Why is it crucial to exclude loan statuses like 'Withdrawn Application' when defining the target variable for a loan risk model?
    A. They represent a small fraction of the data.
    B. They contain too many missing values.
    **C. To prevent data leakage, as these outcomes are known before a loan is funded.**
    D. These statuses are not financially significant to the lender.

2.  During EDA, you find that `loanAmount` is highly skewed. How should this discovery primarily influence your choice of imputation for missing values in this feature?
    A. Use mean imputation as it is the simplest to implement.
    **B. Prefer median imputation as it is less sensitive to outliers and skewness.**
    C. Drop all rows with missing `loanAmount`.
    D. Use a constant value of 0 for imputation.

3.  The data dictionary states loans are "successfully funded," yet the target variable includes "bad loans." How should an ML engineer reconcile this?
    A. Ignore the data dictionary as it is often outdated.
    B. Remove all "bad loan" records as they are clearly data errors.
    **C. Assume "funded" means passed initial screening and document this assumption, noting that clarification would be sought in a real project.**
    D. Conclude that the dataset is unusable for predicting risk.

4.  What is a significant potential downside of using median imputation for missing numerical data?
    A. It is computationally very expensive compared to other methods.
    **B. It can distort the original data distribution and reduce variance.**
    C. It cannot be used on skewed data.
    D. It introduces a new category, which tree-based models cannot handle.

5.  After creating date-based features (year, month, day), what is the most effective way to assess their usefulness for the model?
    A. Visually inspect the feature values in a table.
    B. Assume they are useful as date information is always important.
    C. Measure the Pearson correlation between the new features and the target.
    **D. Analyze feature importance plots (e.g., from LightGBM) or use permutation importance.**

6.  While an `id` column is removed before training, what is a critical use for it in the overall ML lifecycle?
    A. It can be used as a seed for random number generators.
    B. It can be used as a categorical feature if the cardinality is low.
    **C. For traceability, error analysis, and joining with other data sources.**
    D. To check if the dataset has duplicate rows.

    A. LightGBM has better-looking visualizations.
    B. LightGBM handles categorical features automatically without any preprocessing.
    **C. LightGBM is generally faster due to its histogram-based algorithm and Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS).**
    D. LightGBM is less prone to overfitting than XGBoost.

8.  What is the primary motivation for using a time-based split for training, validating, and testing a financial risk model?
    A. To make the training process faster.
    **B. To prevent data leakage by ensuring the model is not trained on future data it would not have seen in a real-world scenario.**
    C. To ensure each set has an equal number of records.
    D. To simplify the data preprocessing steps.

9.  Why is *stratified* K-Fold cross-validation particularly important when tuning a loan risk model?
    A. It shuffles the data more randomly than standard K-Fold.
    **B. It ensures that each fold has a representative proportion of good and bad loans, which is crucial for imbalanced datasets.**
    C. It is the only cross-validation method compatible with Optuna.
    D. It helps the model train faster by reducing the dataset size in each fold.

10. In loan risk prediction, why might a company prioritize a model with higher recall, even if it means slightly lower precision?
    A. Higher recall always leads to a higher F1-score and better overall accuracy.
    B. A false positive (flagging a good loan as risky) is financially more damaging than a false negative.
    **C. A false negative (missing a risky loan) is extremely costly, as it leads to a direct financial loss from default.**
    D. Higher recall models are easier to interpret for non-technical stakeholders.

11. To validate the assumption of an "80% loss rate on defaulted loans" for a business impact analysis, what is the best approach?
    A. Use an industry-standard value found in a blog post.
