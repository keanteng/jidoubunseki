# MCQ Generation

The doc shows some extracted text from a machine learning notebook where it works to build a loan risk prediction system. You can find the system architecture in part-1.pdf.
You are require to create 50 multiple choice questions with the answer highlighted in bold, formatting using markdown based on the source.

Here are some requirement for the question:

- Question the candidate why he perform a tasks at what reason
- You should ask tough question to the candidate especially the modelling part, make sure he really understand the model, why he use it and how
- Evaluate the document and think out of the box to ask question, you are actually giving assessment to machine learning engineer to evaluate their ability       

# General Question Generation

As a hiring manager with 30 years experience, what are the question you will give to candidate for the following tasks, provide answer and question for a total of 35 question.

The candidate is to perform a take home assessment for building an automated machine learning pipeline for loan risk prediction.

The assessment information is provided and for part-1.pdf and part-2.pdf, there are the candidate solution.

You should grill the candidate, ask him tough questions, make sure he understand the algorithm. Make this interview as tough as possible.

# General Question MCQ

You are a multiple question designer expert with 30 years experience. Created 40 MCQ questions and highlight the answer in bold with proper formatting in Markdown.

The questions should test the candidate critical thinking to make it a better Machine Learning Engineer.

# Algorithm & Pipeline Part

Based on the given resources, create 25 discussion question with answer.

You are an expert Machine Learning Engineer with 30 years experience. Discuss thoroughly how the automatic pipeline should be build and investigate throughly why LightBGM is used and why. All decision made should be justified. 

You are provided with the assignment question as well as the candidate solution in part-1.pdf and part-2.pdf, review them and incorporate the feedback into your discussion.

You should delve deep into the candidate decision in seek for justification. Ask hard question, make the candidate difficult.
